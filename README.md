# Time-of-Flight-TFG

For the first iterations, a folder has been created to make the first tests to ensure we can represent figures (in this case, squared ones).
This folder has not yet start working with the algorithm (the last commit shows the mass_center calculation but is not probed or optimized), only the representations of figures.
